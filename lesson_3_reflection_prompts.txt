When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When your work has to be shared or worked on by multiple people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because sometimes you are working on a project on a specific version and
    syncing it with github would erase the changes you perform.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are done when starting to work on somebody else's piece of code.
    Clones are done whenever I want to bring a code to my computer.
    Branches are done whenever I want to deviate from the main development
    of the project and work on a variation.

stored locally?
