How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me see all the parts that were changed. It put it right next
    to a correct version, so it's both easier to see and easy to correct.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would allow me to correct bugs in a fraction of the time it would have taken me otherwise. If I implement something differently, I could see
    what steps I forgot or did differently and understand how they caused
    a bug. I could also try and see which version is the one that caused the bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Cons - You sometimes lose information, especially short-term.
    Small features will have to be rewritten from scratch.
    Pros - You always save something you consider valid.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In some scenarios, one single logical change is reflected in multiple files,
    whereas in others, it doesn't and therefore displaying more than one changed
    files in a commiting point only clutters the log and makes it harder to 
    understand.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Run the log, see what was the last version that something was touched and 
    use diff to compare it to my current version.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    By knowing that there is a way of reverting and pinpointing the 
    exact moment when things got screwed, I can save without fearing
    too much consequences as I know finding the error will be 
    quite easy.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Working on projects on my own, reflect my changes in the log. And Easily 
    access all of my changes. Also, try to use it with online scripts
    and see what other people wrote.
