What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	The repository starts being tracked by Git. Meaning starting now, if you commit
	in this directory all the changes will be tracked.
	This sets up the hierarchy you wish to track. Sepcifyig how
	broad or narrow the project you want to track is.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area gives you a way to track mid-term changes, before you commit 
	them. That way you can make sure all the changes you performed are
	relevant before you commit them and make them part of your project.
	It also allows you to have a QA environment.
